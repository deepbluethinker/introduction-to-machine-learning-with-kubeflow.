In this module we're going to walk through installing Kubeflow on IBM Bluemix.  While this is very
similar to installing Kubeflow on other cloud providers, there are some tricks and gotchyas specific
to Bluemix we want the reader to be aware of.


=== In this guide we are going to

* Create a Kubernetes Cluster on IBM Bluemix
* Create a Bucket in IBM Object Store and enable the S3 interface
* Install Kubeflow
* Train a simple Tensorflow model (MNIST)
* Create a serving layer for the model to predict new hand written digits


IMPORTANT: We presume the user has already signed up for an IBMCloud account, has installed the CLI tools, and has logged in
at the command line. Please go to https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cli/index.html#overview for more info on installing
the CLI tools.

== Creating a Kubernetes Cluster in IBM Cloud


== Creating a Bucket in IBM Object Store

To create an S3 bucket using the Bluemix Web GUI, first log into IBM Cloud.  You will initially be brought to the
Dashboard.  In this section, we are going to provision a Cloud Object storage instance and setup a bucket with S3 interface.
If you already have a Cloud Object Storage instance you wish to use, please skip ahead to step *step number*.

==== Provisioning Cloud Object Storage

When you login you should be at the Dashboard.  The first step is to click on the Catalog tab at the top of the screen.

In the next screen, search for 'Object Storage', you should see the following icon come up- click that.

In the next screen, feel free to name your service something fun or to use the name generated by the system. Click 'Create'
when you're done (in the bottom left corner).

WARNING: You can only have one instance of a Lite plan per service. If you already have a Cloud Object Storage Lite,
you'll have to use that one.

==== Creating the Bucket with S3 Interface

After you have created the Object Cloud Storage instance, you can create buckets within it.  You should come to a page
that looks like this.  Click on the 'Create Bucket' button off to the right.

On the next page, let's create our bucket.  For the purposes of this tutorial, we're going to call the bucket `mnist-bucket-tutorial`.

IMPORTANT: Set the resiliancy to "Cross Region" and the location to "us-geo". These are not the default settings.

Finally scroll down and click "Create Bucket".
